I can help you write the `README.md` and a disclaimer for your project. To better assist you, I'll need to review the contents of the Jupyter notebook you uploaded. I'll take a look at the file now.

The notebook appears to contain a project involving Hugging Face's `transformers`, `datasets`, and various evaluation tools for NLP tasks. Based on this, I can draft a `README.md` and a disclaimer for your project. Hereâ€™s a draft:

# Capstone Project: NLP Model Fine-Tuning and Evaluation

This project focuses on fine-tuning a pre-trained NLP model for text generation tasks using the Hugging Face Transformers library. The primary model used in this project is BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) for conditional text generation tasks, with a focus on evaluation using metrics like ROUGE and BLEU.

## Project Structure

- **Library Installation**: The notebook starts by installing necessary libraries such as `transformers`, `datasets`, `evaluate`, and more.
- **Data Preparation**: Dataset loading is done using the Hugging Face `datasets` library, including functions for splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets.
- **Model Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tuning of the pre-trained BART model using `Seq2SeqTrainer`, along with learning rate scheduling and early stopping based on validation performance.
- **Evaluation**: After training, the model is evaluated using standard metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and others to measure the quality of generated text against reference texts.

## Requirements

To run this project locally, ensure you have Python installed and the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install transformers[torch] datasets sentencepiece sacrebleu evaluate rouge_score -U
```

### Key Dependencies

- [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) for the model and training utilities.
- [Datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/) for loading and preprocessing data.
- [Evaluate](https://huggingface.co/docs/evaluate/) for evaluating text generation performance.

## How to Use

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/capstone-project
   cd capstone-project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** using `pip` as shown above.

3. **Run the notebook**:
   You can open the notebook in Jupyter or any other notebook environment like Google Colab.

4. **Train the model**:
   The notebook contains code to fine-tune the BART model on your dataset. Adjust the training arguments as needed for your specific task.

5. **Evaluate the results**:
   After training, the model will be evaluated based on the specified metrics. You can adjust the evaluation metrics or add new ones according to your project requirements.

## Future Work

- Implement additional model architectures (e.g., GPT or T5) for comparison.
- Explore hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.
- Experiment with other text generation tasks like summarization or translation.
